    "summary": "The patient, Mickey Mouse, presented with persistent lower back pain following a motor vehicle accident. Despite conservative management including NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and physical therapy, the pain has not significantly improved. The medical records suggest that the pain has been present for more than 3 months and there are no acute neurologic deficits. Imaging did not provide a diagnostic explanation for the pain. The plan suggests a Medial Branch Block (MBB) as the next step in the diagnostic process. Based on the evidence, the patient appears to meet the criteria for a \"Diagnostic facet joint injection\" rather than a \"Therapeutic facet joint injection.\" The patient has also met the treatment criteria for NSAIDs and physical therapy or home exercise within the last year. However, the procedure, a facet joint injection, is not justified at this point as the patient has not yet undergone any diagnostic medial branch blocks or intra-articular zygapophysial joint injections. The next appropriate step would be to proceed with the diagnostic facet joint injection (MBB) as planned to confirm the diagnosis before considering therapeutic interventions.",

            "reasoning": "Based on the provided medical record, we need to determine whether the patient requires a diagnostic facet joint injection or a therapeutic facet joint injection. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. Initial Encounter: The patient, Mickey Mouse, was involved in a motor vehicle accident and reported lumbar pain. The lumbar spine X-ray showed no evidence of acute traumatic injury or significant pathology, only mild age-related changes. The diagnosis was suspected lumbar strain with possible nerve root irritation secondary to the motor vehicle accident. Conservative management with NSAIDs and muscle relaxants was prescribed, along with rest, heat/cold therapy, and a referral to physical therapy.\n\n2. Follow-Up Encounter: The patient continued to experience persistent lower back pain that has not significantly improved despite conservative management, including NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and weeks of physical therapy. The physical examination during the follow-up revealed tenderness to palpation in the lower spine over facet joints and a slight limited range of motion due to discomfort. The assessment noted chronic lower back pain, possibly related to facet joint pathology, unresponsive to conservative treatment.\n\n3. Plan: The plan suggests trying a medial branch block (MBB) to pinpoint pain-causing nerves, which involves an anesthetic injection near key nerves. If the MBB helps, the provider is considering radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for longer relief.\n\nGiven this information, the patient has persistent symptoms despite conservative treatment, and the provider is considering further diagnostic procedures (MBB) to identify the source of pain. Since the MBB is a diagnostic procedure to confirm whether the facet joints are the source of pain, and there is no mention of prior diagnostic injections, it seems that the patient has not yet had a diagnostic facet joint injection.\n\nTherefore, based on the balance of evidence, the patient appears to meet the criteria for a \"Diagnostic facet joint injection\" rather than a \"Therapeutic facet joint injection,\" as the therapeutic approach would typically follow a confirmed diagnosis of facet joint pain, which has not yet been established in this case. The next appropriate step would be to proceed with the diagnostic facet joint injection (MBB) as planned to confirm the diagnosis before considering therapeutic interventions such as RFA.",

Back or neck pain ≥ 3 months suggestive of facet joint origin:\nThe patient, Mickey Mouse, initially presented with lower back pain following a motor vehicle accident on 12/10/2021. The follow-up encounter on 04/21/2023 indicates persistent lower back pain, which has not significantly improved despite conservative management including NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and weeks of physical therapy. This suggests that the pain has been present for more than 3 months. Additionally, the physical examination notes tenderness to palpation in the lower spine over facet joints, which could suggest facet joint pathology. Therefore, criterion A appears to be met.\n\nB. No acute neurologic deficits:\nThe medical records indicate that the patient has no acute neurologic deficits. The neurological examination from the initial visit and the follow-up visit both show that cranial nerves II-XII are intact, and motor strength is 5/5 in all extremities. There are no signs of acute neurologic deficits such as numbness, weakness, or loss of reflexes. Therefore, criterion B is met.\n\nC. Imaging nondiagnostic for etiology of pain:\nThe initial lumbar spine X-ray report from 12/10/2021 states that there is no evidence of acute traumatic injury or significant pathology. It mentions mild incidental age-related changes and a congenital variant (bifid appearance of S1 vertebra) but no abnormalities that would explain the etiology of the patient's pain. Since the imaging does not provide a diagnostic explanation for the pain, criterion C is met.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the balance of evidence from the medical records, all three criteria (A, B, and C) appear to be met.",

NSAIDs or acetaminophen ≥ 3 weeks (Option A):\n   - The medical record from the initial visit on 12/10/2021 indicates that NSAIDs and muscle relaxants were prescribed for the management of suspected lumbar strain following a motor vehicle accident.\n   - The follow-up record from 04/21/2023 mentions that the patient has persistent lower back pain that has not significantly improved despite conservative management, including NSAIDs.\n   - This suggests that the patient has been on NSAIDs for a period extending beyond 3 weeks, as there is a gap of more than a year between the initial prescription and the follow-up, and the patient's condition has not significantly improved.\n\n2. Activity modification ≥ 4 weeks (Option B):\n   - There is no explicit mention of activity modification in the medical records provided. However, the management plan from the initial visit does advise rest, which could imply some form of activity modification.\n   - Since there is no clear documentation of a specific activity modification plan or its duration, we cannot conclusively determine if this criterion has been met based on the balance of evidence.\n\n3. PT or home exercise ≥ 4 weeks (Option C):\n   - The initial management plan includes a referral to physical therapy.\n   - The follow-up record from 04/21/2023 indicates that the patient has been undergoing physical therapy as part of the conservative management.\n   - Given the time frame between the initial visit and the follow-up, it is reasonable to infer that the patient has participated in physical therapy or home exercise for at least 4 weeks.\n\nBased on the balance of evidence, it appears that the criteria for NSAIDs (Option A) and PT or home exercise (Option C) have been met.
